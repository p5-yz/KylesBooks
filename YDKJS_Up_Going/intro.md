## Code

Let's start from the beginning.

A program, often referred to as source code or just code, is a set of special instructions to tell the computer what tasks to perform. Usually code is saved in a text file, although with JavaScript you can also type code directly into a developer console in a browser, which we'll cover shortly.

The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called a computer language, sometimes referred to as its syntax, much the same as English tells you how to spell words and how to create valid sentences using words and punctuation.

## Statements

In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a statement.

## Expressions

Statements are made up of one or more expressions. An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.

For example:
```
a = b * 2;
```
This statement has four expressions in it:

- ``` 2 ``` is a literal value expression
- ``` b ``` is a variable expression, which means to retrieve its current value
- ``` b * 2 ``` is an arithmetic expression, which means to do the multiplication
- ``` a = b * 2 ``` is an assignment expression, which means to assign the result of the b * 2 expression to the variable a (more on assignments later)
